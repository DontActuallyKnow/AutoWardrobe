# AutoWardrobe
AutoWardrobe uses ShadyAddons to quickly switch wardrobes. You can bind the command to a hotkey in Skytils or SBE for easier use. Currently in pretty heavy beta but works fine. It is also unbannable!

Currently source code is unavailable until the mod is out of beta with more features, but we are working closely with the Skytils developer team in order to make it more optimised.

Old releases are being removed to avoid confusion.

**Features TODO**
- Auto Salvage
- Auto Sell
- More auto things basically
